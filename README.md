# Elitmus-Puzzle

This is a Puzzle developed to assess one of the soft skills.
From this puzzle i tried to assess the CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS of the user through a small game.

A single image is given in the puzzle. This image is displayed only for 10 seconds.
The user can also avail the replay button for the image. But doing this will effect their score in the soft skills. 


Criteria for calculating the critical Thinking Skills:
The image is followed by 5 questions.

For every correct answer, the user will be awarde with 20 marks.
For every opted hint button, a score of 5 is deducted from the user's score.
For every opted replay button, a score of 7 is deducted from the user's score.


This is the basic criteria i framed up in order to calculate the critical thinking skills of a user based on the puzzle.
